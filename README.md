<h2>Description</h2>
<p>lipu lipu is an easy to use app to help learn Toki Pona, the constructed language (conlang) created by Sonja Lang. The language is designed to be very simple and easy to learn, and is meant to help simplify thought. With a searchable dictionary, fully fledged lessons, and customizable flashcards, lipu lipu is the perfect tool to aide the learning process.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Searchable dictionary, featuring 140 words</li>
  <li>Phrasebook with common ways to say different phrases</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep in mind that Toki Pona is a very flexible language! There are many different ways you could say any concept, and the phrasebook just gives suggestions of common ways it could be said.</li>

    <li>Currently WIP</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>lipu lipu is not currently on the App Store, so you will have to sideload it onto your device.</p>
<p>To sideload the app if your device is unjailbroken, download the .ipa file from releases, and then follow one of the methods below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reccomended free: <a href="https://sidestore.io">SideStore</a></li>
  <li>Reccomended paid: <a href="https://kravasign.com">KravaSign</a></li>
  <li>Alternate free: <a href="https://altstore.io">Altstore</a></li>
  <li>Alternate free: <a href="https://sideloadly.io">Sideloadly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With any of the free methods, you will have to resign the app every 7 days and can only sideloadly up to 2 other apps. I reccomend SideStore over the others because it makes this process easier by letting you do it directly from your phone. KravaSign is what I personally use, because you don't have to resign apps and you can sign more than just 3.</p>
