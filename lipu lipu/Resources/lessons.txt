The Language of Good: Toki Pona is a simple language, originally with only 120 words to work with. A handful of words of gained popularity since then, but the vocabulary remains very small. Sonja Lang created the language with the intention of simplifying thought into its most pure form. Without any of the extra fancy words a natural languages like English provides, you have are forced to more directly say what you mean. Minimalism is the core of Toki Pona. §§With such a limited amount of words to choose from, you have to get creative with how you communicate ideas. For example, the language doesn't provide a word for 'friend', but you can instead say 'jan pona' (lit. good person). If you wanted to say you're hungry, you could say you 'wile moku', meaning 'need to eat'. 
The Ambiguity of Words: Because of the language's small vocabulary, its words must have broad meanings. For example, the word 'kulupu' could mean a community, a society, a group, a collection, a team, or a crowd. The word 'lawa' could mean head, mind/brain, a government, a leader, a rule, to control, or to lead. The word 'moli' could mean death, dead, to die, dying, to kill, or to murder.
Flexibility: The inherent ambiguity in Toki Pona words makes the language very flexible. There are numerous ways to communicate the same idea, and all are equally correct. For example, if you wanted to say 'coffee', you might say 'telo pimeja' (dark/brown liquid), 'telo wawa' (strong liquid), or even 'telo pi lape ala' (liquid of not sleeping).

What is a pronoun?: A pronoun is a word we use to refer to something/someone without using its name. For example, in English we use the word 'you' to refer to someone we are talking to.
