                "text": "Toki Pona is a simple language, originally with only 120 words to work with. A handful of words of gained popularity since then, but the vocabulary remains very small. Sonja Lang created the language with the intention of simplifying thought into its most pure form. Without any of the extra fancy words a natural language like English provides, you are forced to more directly say what you mean. Minimalism is the core of Toki Pona. \n\nWith such a limited amount of words to choose from, you have to get creative with how you communicate ideas. For example, the language doesn't provide a word for 'friend', but you can instead say 'jan pona' (literally: good person). If you wanted to say you're hungry, you could say you 'wile moku', meaning 'need to eat'."

For example, the word 'kulupu' could mean a community, a society, a group, a collection, a team, or a crowd. The word 'lawa' could mean head, mind/brain, a government, a leader, a rule, to control, or to lead. The word 'moli' could mean death, dead, to die, dying, to kill, or to murder."
